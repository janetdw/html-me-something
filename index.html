<h1>&#9733Murphy&#9733</h1></header></div>

<p>Two months after buying our first house (with a fenced yard), my husband and I decided it was time to adopt a dog.
So in June 2009, we went to the 5A's Shelter (Alton Area Animal Aid Association). After we met with a few dogs in the 
"get acquainted" room, Ryan asked me if I had seen the "gnarly" dog in the cage without a name tag. Ryan said 
that dog was calm - not jumping or barking - so he was interested in meeting him/her.</p>

<p>I inquired with a staff member about the dog without a name tag and she seemed confused that we wanted to meet him.
<br><i>"That's Murphy. You want to see him?"</br>
<br>"Umm....yes....Is he available for adoption?"</br>
<br>"Yeah, he is...you want to see him?</i></br></p>

<p>She went on to explain that Murphy had been neglected by his previous owners. He had a skin infection, which caused 
a lot of his hair to fall out. I told her that we'd still like to meet him, so she brought him to us. As soon as 
Murphy walked into the room and Ryan knelt down to pet him, it was love at first sight. We'd found 
our dog.</p>

<p>We brought Murphy home that day and he's turned out to be an awesome dog. He's not very smart (it took a month 
to teach him how to sit), but he's friendly and sweet.</p></article>

<p>In 2011, our friend who is a vet tech posted a picture of a kitten he was keeping at his house until she 
was well enough to be adopted.</p>

<p>I showed this picture to Ryan and told him that I'd started calling her Crow's Eye (after a character from the 
A Song of Ice and Fire series) - he agreed to at least consider adopting her. Our friend brought her over to meet 
Murphy and because that went well, we adopted her shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>While Crow doesn't cuddle with Murphy as much as she did as a kitten, she still likes to be near him.</p>

<p>Crow's Eye is not nearly as friendly as Murphy. As a kitten, she was fine with other animals and people, 
but as she got older the only people she really liked were me and Ryan. In February 2015, Ryan was diagnosed with 
Stage IV colon cancer, and he passed away that October. Murphy was unphased by his absense, but it was more 
difficult on Crow's Eye. Now, for the most part, I'm the only human she is actually friendly with. After meeting 
Crow, people are often surprised to learn that she sleeps with me most nights and often cuddles with me while 
I sit on the couch.</p>
